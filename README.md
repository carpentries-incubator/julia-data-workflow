# Data-intensive research workflows in Julia

[![Lesson](https://img.shields.io/badge/LESSON-pre--alpha-brightgreen)](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/julia-data-workflow/)

_Learn how to use Julia to enable your data-intensive scientific research._

It can be a challenge to know where to start when developing a scalable and reproducible workflow for your data-intensive computations. The [Julia][julia] programming language is notable for enabling researchers and analysts in diverse domains to get a handle on this challenge. Use this lesson to learn how to start implementing effective scientific computing workflows using Julia.
